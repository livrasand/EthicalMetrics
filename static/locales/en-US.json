    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "q1": {
      "question": "What is EthicalMetrics and how does it differ from Google Analytics?",
      "answer": "EthicalMetrics is a self-hosted web analytics platform that prioritizes user privacy. Unlike Google Analytics, it does not collect personal data, use cookies, store IP addresses, or perform device fingerprinting."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "How does EthicalMetrics guarantee user privacy?",
      "answer": "EthicalMetrics implements 'true anonymity' where each event is standalone and cannot be tracked over time. It does not assign visitor_id or associate session events, ensuring analytics work without knowing who you are."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "What metrics can I get with EthicalMetrics?",
      "answer": "The system tracks visits, module usage, load times, most visited pages, average session duration, custom events, bounce rate, devices, browsers, languages, and geographic location (without storing IPs)."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "How do I implement EthicalMetrics on my website?",
      "answer": "First, register your site at https://ethicalmetrics.onrender.com to get your site_id and admin_token. Then add the tracking script to your HTML and optionally define custom modules."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "Does EthicalMetrics respect the browser's 'Do Not Track' setting?",
      "answer": "Yes, EthicalMetrics automatically respects the user's Do Not Track (DNT) setting and disables all tracking when enabled. This ensures full respect for the user's implicit consent."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "What technologies does EthicalMetrics use in its architecture?",
      "answer": "The system is built with Go for the HTTP server, Redis for storage, vanilla JavaScript for the client, UUID token-based authentication, and can be deployed with Docker on platforms like Render."
    },
    "q7": {
      "question": "Can I customize the consent banner?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can easily customize the consent banner by adding data-* attributes to the script tag, including background colors, banner text, button colors, and custom messages."
    },
    "q8": {
      "question": "How do I access my statistics and dashboard?",
      "answer": "You access your private dashboard using the URL with your site_id and admin_token: https://ethicalmetrics.onrender.com/dashboard"
    },
    "q9": {
      "question": "Is EthicalMetrics ready for production or experimental?",
      "answer": "EthicalMetrics is actively developing and described as 'experimental and evolving'. The project seeks community contributors and audits, with many advanced features still in development according to the roadmap."
